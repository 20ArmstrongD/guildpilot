A modular, production-ready Discord bot ecosystem built with Python and py-cord, featuring CI/CD, automated testing, and security-first workflows.



**GuildPilot** is an all-in-one Discord bot designed to manage server operations through a modular, scalable architecture.  
It combines member role automation, game stat lookups, AI chat capabilities, and streaming notifications into a single bot identity.

Rather than running multiple bots per server, GuildPilot acts as a **central command hub** with internally separated modules for maintainability and growth.
